Hi. My name is Gengkun He, you can call me Ahab. I am 19 years old, a student at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and a girl's boyfriend, a front-end developer.

I taught myself web development, mainly front-end development, and have a great interest in functional programming. I like design, music, and painting, which is one of the main reasons why I become a front-end developer. I usually like reading books, watching tv series, watching movies, being dazed and walking with people I like.
